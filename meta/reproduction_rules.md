# Reproduction Rules

## 1. Scope is defined before coding
Every implementation must have a PLAN.md.

## 2. Minimal viable reproduction > full system
A small, correct core is preferred over an incomplete full pipeline.

## 3. Training from scratch is optional
Understanding inference mechanics is usually sufficient.

## 4. Deviations from the paper are documented
If something is skipped or modified, it is stated explicitly.

## 5. Failure is a valid outcome
A failed reproduction with good analysis is success.
