# Reading Principles

## 1. Papers are not read linearly
A paper is read in passes:
- intake
- intuition
- mechanics
- critique
- implementation (optional)

## 2. First read is for *why*, not *how*
Equations are ignored until the intuition is clear.

## 3. If you cannot explain it without math, you do not understand it

## 4. Confusion is expected
Unclear sections are written down verbatim.
Understanding is allowed to be delayed.

## 5. Implementation is a tool, not a goal
If implementing does not improve understanding, it is skipped.
